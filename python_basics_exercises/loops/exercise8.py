# The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.)
# Why does the loop keep running? Modify it so that it stops after
# the first iteration

# while True:
#     print("and on")

# The condition will always be true because there's no break case to say
# otherwise. If we just want to break after one iteration, then we can just
# use the break keyword


while True:
    print("and on")
    break
