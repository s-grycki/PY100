# Using the official Python documentation, can you determine how to
# check whether a string contains a specific substring?

# Under common sequence operations, we can see x in s, where True is returned
# if an item is found within the sequence (or text sequence in this case)

print('he' in 'hello') # => True
print('He' in 'hello') # => False
