# What happens if we take the list ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access
# the element at index position 10? First try to determine what will happen by
# consulting the documentation, then verify your understanding
# in the Python REPL

# It raises an error saying the index is out of range
['fish', 'and', 'chips'][10]
